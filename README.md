# Cricket
One of the most popular games in the world is cricket. A significant section of the
global population enjoys and follows the sport of cricket. The popularity is so great that some
people have started playing computerised cricket games. It is renowned for its unpredictable
nature(Kumar et al., 2018), where a game may suddenly turn in favour of any team. Cricket
is fascinating because of its unpredictable nature, which keeps spectators on the edge of
their seats. It is a challenging sport with numerous factors and choices that affect a team's
chances of success. These factors include player selection, the teamâ€™s past performance,
match circumstances, and opposing team analysis. Teams can increase their chances of
success by gaining insights into these elements and using data analytics to make wise
decisions. Teams can decide on strategy and tactics more effectively by looking at team
performance data and opponent weaknesses. Also, teams can utilise machine learning
techniques to forecast match results to be ready for various circumstances. Therefore, for
contemporary cricket teams wanting to obtain a competitive edge, data analytics is turning
into a crucial instrument.
User-friendly interfaces are frequently absent from sports outcome prediction models,
which might restrict the general public's access to and utility of these tools. Because of this,
it may be difficult for users to use the models properly and gain insightful data from them.
This project aims to use data analytics and machine learning techniques to create a
predictive model for the outcome of a cricket match. To create a trustworthy and user-friendly
prediction tool for cricket fans, this project pinpoints the critical variables that affect match
results.
